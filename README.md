# Basic-Employee-Database-

It is a simple employee database implemented using C++ file handling. It can be used to add information about an employee, add the date when the a task was assigned and then give points to the employee (positive or negative) based upon when he finished that task.

PS : It was one of my very first projects that I did back in my 12th standard so the readability of the code is not that great.
